# Securedis

Securedis is a (mini) redis server that will provide a simple way to encrypt and decrypt your data.

üöß **_Currently, in development_** üöß

‚ö†Ô∏è *Right now, the server can operate basic Redis commands, but it does not encrypt or decrypt the data.*

## Commands supported
- [X] PING
- [X] ECHO
- [X] SET (with and without `PX` option)
- [X] GET
- [ ] LOAD (from a CSV file)
- [ ] SAVE (to a CSV file)
- [ ] KEYS
- [ ] DEL

## Data types supported
- [X] Strings
- [X] Integers
- [ ] Lists

## Prerequisites

2. Clone the repository
3. Launch the server with the script `./start.sh`

## How to use
1. The server will start on your localhost `6379` port by default.
2. You can connect to the server by using the Redis CLI (https://redis.io/topics/rediscli)
